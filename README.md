# Computed Tomography Reconstruction
A project for my Image Processing course. It involves image reconstruction from a sinogram by making use of the Fourier Slice Theorem, Filtered Backprojection and Sinogram Generation.

# Running the programs
The easiest way to run the program is by simply typing `PROGRAM_FILE_NAME(func_params...)` in the MATLAB command prompt.
